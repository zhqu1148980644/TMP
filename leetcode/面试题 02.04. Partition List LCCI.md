Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

Example:

Input: head = 3->5->8->5->10->2->1, x = 5
Output: 3->1->2->10->5->5->8


#### Solutions

1. ##### group into two lists

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* partition(ListNode* head, int x) {
        ListNode less {0}, greater {0};
        ListNode * pl = &less, *pg = &greater;
        while (head) {
            if (head->val < x) {
                pl = pl->next = head;
            }
            else {
                pg = pg->next = head;
            }
            ListNode * next = head->next;
            head->next = nullptr;
            head = next;
        }

        pl->next = greater.next;
        return less.next;
    }
};
```
