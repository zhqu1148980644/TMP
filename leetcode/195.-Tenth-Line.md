Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.

Example:

Assume that file.txt has the following content:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:

Line 10
Note:
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

#### Solutions

1. ##### head/tail

- tail -n+num output lines starting with num'line(1-basesd)

```bash
tail -n+10 file.txt | head -1
```

OR

```bash
# cat file.txt | wc -l
# grep -c "" file.txt
if [ `wc -l file.txt|cut -d " " -f 1` -ge 10 ]
then
    echo `head -n 10 file.txt| tail -n 1`
fi
```
