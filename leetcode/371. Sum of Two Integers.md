```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        // loop until the carry part changes to 0
        while (b) {
            // 0 + 0 == 0 ^ 0  0 + 1 == 0 ^ 1   1 + 1 == 1 ^ 1 + carry
            int sum = a ^ b;
            // store carry part in b
            b = ((unsigned int)a & b) << 1;
            a = sum;
        }
        return a;
    }
