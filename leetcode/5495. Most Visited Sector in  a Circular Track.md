Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2]
Example 3:

Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
1 <= m <= 100
rounds.length == m + 1
1 <= rounds[i] <= n
rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1] for 0 <= i < m


#### Solutions

1. ##### simulation O(nm)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        vector<int> count(n + 1), res;
        int maxc = 1; count[rounds.back()]++;
        for (int i = 0; i < rounds.size() - 1; i++) {
            int st = rounds[i], ed = (rounds[i + 1]) % (n + 1);
            while (st != ed) {
                maxc = max(++count[st], maxc);
                st = (st + 1) % (n + 1);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (count[i] == maxc)
                res.push_back(i);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

2. ##### math O(n)

- All region visited by full rounds(start -> 2 * start -> 3 * start) has the same visiting counts. ie: nodes visited in the last unfull round are the answer.
- Note that indexes are 1-based thus the module should be plused by 1.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        vector<int> res;
        int st = rounds[0], ed = rounds.back();
        while (st != ed) {
            res.push_back(st);
            st = max(1, (st + 1) % (n + 1));
        }
        res.push_back(ed);
        sort(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
};
```
