#### Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

#### Note:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```
Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

2. ##### priority queue and stack

- This problem can be seen as a special(constrained) case of problem 122 where we find all contiguous vally-peak pair then buy in valley and sell in peak, thus summing up all differences of vally-peak will get the answer. Since `k` is constrained, instead of picking all v-p pairs, only the highest `k` pairs can be selected.
- The key piont is to find all vp pairs, however, the number of transactions are limited, we may need to merge some vp_pairs into one transaction.
    - In the first case, as making one merged transaction has profit `p2 - v1` which is definitly smaller than single transaction with either `p1 - v1` or `p2 - v2` profit. Merging this two transactions into one transaction is meaningless(choose the largest between `p1 - v1` and `p2 - v2` is more suitable).
    - In the second case, though making two transactions has higher profit than the profit of merging them into one transaction(`p2 - v1`), when k is constrained and only `one` transaction is left, choosing the merged transaction is better than either one of two single transactions.
        -  To combine these two possible transactions, treat `p2 - v1` as one transaction and `p1 - v2` as the other. When two transactions are available, choose both `p2 - v1` and `p1 - v2`. When one transaction is available, choose `p2 - v1`: ie: the merged transaction.
