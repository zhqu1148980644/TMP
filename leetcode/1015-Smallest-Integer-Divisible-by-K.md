Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 

Note:

1 <= K <= 10^5

- If `K % 2 != 0 && K % 5 != 0`, there must be an answer.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0)
            return -1;
        int len = 1;
        for (int n = 1; n % K != 0; len++)
            n = (n * 10 + 1) % K;

        return len;
    }
};
```
