title: Maximum Binary Tree II
date: 2021-01-04
---
We are given the root node of a maximum tree: a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree.

Just as in the previous problem, the given tree was constructed from an list A (root = Construct(A)) recursively with the following Construct(A) routine:

If A is empty, return null.
Otherwise, let A[i] be the largest element of A.  Create a root node with value A[i].
The left child of root will be Construct([A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]])
The right child of root will be Construct([A[i+1], A[i+2], ..., A[A.length - 1]])
Return root.
Note that we were not given A directly, only a root node root = Construct(A).

Suppose B is a copy of A with the value val appended to it.  It is guaranteed that B has unique values.

Return Construct(B).

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
Explanation: A = [1,4,2,3], B = [1,4,2,3,5]
Example 2:



Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]
Explanation: A = [2,1,5,4], B = [2,1,5,4,3]
Example 3:



Input: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,3]
Explanation: A = [2,1,5,3], B = [2,1,5,3,4]
 

Constraints:

1 <= B.length <= 100

#### Solutions

1. #### recursion

- Search in the right tree(As the val is appended at the back), find the fist smaller node, then create a new node with the smaller subtree as it's left child(since they are left to the target val), return this newly created node as the new right child of the parent node.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (!root || root->val < val)
            return new TreeNode(val, root, nullptr);
        root->right = insertIntoMaxTree(root->right, val);
        return root;
    }
};
```
