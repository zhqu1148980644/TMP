Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

Example:

Input: 38
Output: 2 
Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. 
Â             Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
