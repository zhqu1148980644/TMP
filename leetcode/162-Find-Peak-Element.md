A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return #### the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 1 or 5 
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
             or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

#### Note:

- Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

#### Solutions

1. ##### binary search

- Shrink the searhing range 2 folds in each iteration.
- if `mid < mid + 1` then the peak must be in the right side and vice versa.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int lo = 0, hi = nums.size() - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + ((hi - lo) >> 1);
            if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1])
                lo = mid + 1;
            else
                hi = mid;
        }
        return lo;
    }
};
```
