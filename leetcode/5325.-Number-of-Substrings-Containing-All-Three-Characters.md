Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 

Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

 

#### Constraints:

-    3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
-    s only consists of a, b or c characters.

```c++
#define valid(x) ((x) == 'a' || (x) == 'b' || (x) == 'c')
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, count = 0;
        int c[128] = {0};

        int num = 0;
        while (j < s.size()) {
            if (valid(s[j]) && ++c[s[j]] == 1)
                count++;
            while (count == 3) {
                // do not count cases when we extend to the left, as those cases will be counted before
                num += s.size() - j;
                if (--c[s[i]] == 0 && valid(s[i]))
                    --count;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }

        return num;
    }
