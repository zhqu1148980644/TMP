In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

Return the element repeated N times.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
 

Note:

4 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] < 10000
A.length is even

#### Solutions

1. ##### math

- Since the majority has half of the total size, the distance between two majority numbers is at most `2`(Except for len == 4).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& A) {
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size() - 2; i++)
            if (A[i] == A[i + 1] || A[i] == A[i + 2])
                return A[i];
        return A.back();
    }
};
```
