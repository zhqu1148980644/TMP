There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.

Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

 

Example 1:

Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
 

Constraints:

1 <= bookings.length <= 20000
1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000
1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000

#### Solutions

1. ##### discretization

- The same as counting occupied meeting rooms at each time point.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        vector<int> res(n + 1);
        for (auto & e : bookings) {
            res[e[0] - 1] += e[2];
            res[e[1]] -= e[2];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            res[i] += res[i - 1];

        res.pop_back();
        return res;
    }
};
```
