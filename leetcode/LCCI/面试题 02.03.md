title: Delete Middle Node LCCI
date: 2021-01-04
---
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Â 

Example:

Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
Output: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f


#### Solutions

- Note that the given node is not the head of the list but the middle node itself.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        if (node->next) {
            *node = *(node->next);
        }
    }
};
```
