Given a text file file.txt, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the ' ' character.

Example:

If file.txt has the following content:

name age
alice 21
ryan 30
Output the following:

name alice ryan
age 21 30


#### Solutions

1. ##### cut/echo

```bash
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.

ncol=`head -n 1 file.txt | wc -w`

for col in `seq 1 $ncol`
do
    echo `cut -d ' ' -f $col file.txt`
done
```


2. ##### python

```python
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.

python3 -c "print('\n'.join(' '.join(row) for row in zip(*map(str.split, open('file.txt').readlines()))))"
```
