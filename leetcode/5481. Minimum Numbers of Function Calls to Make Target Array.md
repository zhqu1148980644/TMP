Two rules:
    - increase a single number by 1
    - multiple all numbers by 2

Your task is to form an integer array nums from an initial array of zeros arr that is the same size as nums.

Return the minimum number of function calls to make nums from arr.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).
Double all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).
Increment by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] -> [1, 5] (2 operations).
Total of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment by 1 (both elements) [0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [1, 1] (2 operations).
Double all the elements: [1, 1] -> [2, 2] (1 operation).
Total of operations: 2 + 1 = 3.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: (initial)[0,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1] -> [2,0,2] -> [2,1,2] -> [4,2,4] -> [4,2,5](nums).
Example 4:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,4]
Output: 7
Example 5:

Input: nums = [2,4,8,16]
Output: 8
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9


#### Solutions

1. ##### greedy

- Reverse the whole process. ie: from the target array to all zeros, then rules are changed to either `deduce` by 1 or `divide` by 2.
- When a number becomes an odd number at some point, we must must apply the first rule.
- Smaller numbers share multiplication steps with larger numbers.


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int deduce = 0, maxdivide = 0;
        for (auto n : nums) {
            int divide = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                if (n & 1) {
                    n--; deduce++;
                }
                else {
                    n >>= 1; divide++;
                }
            }
            maxdivide = max(maxdivide, divide);
        }
        return deduce + maxdivide;
    }
};
```
