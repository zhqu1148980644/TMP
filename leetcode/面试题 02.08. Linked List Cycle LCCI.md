Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop.

Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle

Can you solve it without using additional space?

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}

 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode * slow = head, * fast = head;
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            slow = slow->next;
            if (slow == fast) break;
        }
        if (!fast || !fast->next) return nullptr;

        slow = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
