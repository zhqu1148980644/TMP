In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. 

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
Example 2:

Input: [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
 

Note:

1 <= time.length <= 60000
1 <= time[i] <= 500

#### Solutions

1. ##### math

- `(a + b) % p == (a % p + b % p) % p`
- Store visited numbers' mod `n % 60` in the hashmap, then for the curent number search for `(60 - n % p) % p` as the count of pairs with j as self.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        vector<int> count(60);
        int res = 0;
        for (auto t : time) {
            res += count[(60 - (t % 60)) % 60];
            count[t % 60]++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
